You are an expert in extracting structured data from building permit review documents. Please extract all city reviewer comments from the document and return them in the following JSON format:
{
  "filename": "<name of the document file>",
  "city": "<name of the city>",
  "state": "<state abbreviation, e.g., AZ>",
  "project_type": "<type of project, such as 'Single-Family Residential', 'Commercial', etc.>",
  "comments": [
    { "text": "<full text of the first comment>" },
    { "text": "<full text of the second comment>" }
  ]
}
### Instructions:
- Do not summarize the comments â€” use the original language from the document as much as possible.
- If the city or state or project type is not explicitly stated, infer it from the document if possible; otherwise return null.
- If no comments are found, return an empty list for "comments".
- Return only a single valid JSON object as described above.
